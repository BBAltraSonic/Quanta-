# Production Readiness Specification

## Purpose
Remove all mock data, demo fixtures, and fallback fake responses so production builds use only real backends and production configurations. Prepare the Flutter social UI app for production deployment with zero demo content.

## Inputs
- Production API base URLs and endpoints
- Authentication method and credentials management
- Feature flags source (if any)
- Caching layer details
- Major app surfaces: Feed, Profile, Search, Notifications, Messages, Create Post, Comments

## Outputs
- Release build that functions end-to-end solely with production services
- Documented error/empty states for all major screens
- Zero inclusion of mock/demo assets or code paths
- Production-grade user experience with proper error handling

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Release Build Integrity**: Release build compiles and runs with production endpoints only; no mock/demo content is bundled or reachable at runtime
2. **Code Cleanliness**: Static scan shows zero matches for banned patterns in lib/ and assets/ (mock, fake, demo, sample, lorem, faker)
3. **Empty/Error States**: All primary screens handle empty/error states without showing demo content
4. **Test Isolation**: Tests pass; any mocks exist only under test/ and are excluded from release
5. **CI Protection**: CI guard fails if banned patterns are introduced in lib/ or assets/

## Constraints
- Flutter version/channel: TBD (will be detected)
- Min Android/iOS versions: TBD (will be detected from pubspec)
- Flavoring approach: TBD (will analyze main_dev.dart, main_prod.dart patterns)
- Networking stack: TBD (will detect http vs Dio usage)
- State management: TBD (will detect Provider, Riverpod, GetX, Bloc)
- DI container: TBD (will detect get_it or similar)
- Storage: TBD (will detect Hive, sqflite usage)
- Analytics/crash reporting: TBD (will inventory)
- Privacy/PII constraints: Follow best practices for production apps

## Timeline
Estimated completion: 2-3 weeks depending on codebase size and mock usage extent

## Approval
- [ ] Stakeholder review completed
- [ ] Technical lead approval
- [ ] QA plan approved
