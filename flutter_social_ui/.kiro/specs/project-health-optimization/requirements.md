# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical code quality, performance, and maintainability issues identified in the Flutter social UI project. The analysis revealed 1169 issues including syntax errors, type mismatches, unused imports, missing dependencies, broken tests, and code quality violations. This comprehensive optimization will systematically resolve all issues while maintaining application functionality and improving overall project health.

5. WHEN organizing imports THEN the system SHALL follow Dart style guidelines

### Requirement 5: Code Quality and Best Practices

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow Flutter and Dart best practices, so that it's maintainable, readable, and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using print statements THEN the system SHALL replace them with proper logging
2. WHEN creating regular expressions THEN the system SHALL use valid syntax
3. WHEN implementing mock classes THEN the system SHALL follow proper mock patterns
4. IF code violates linting rules THEN the system SHALL fix violations while preserving functionality
5. WHEN refactoring code THEN the system SHALL maintain existing public APIs

### Requirement 6: Performance and Resource Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized performance and efficient resource usage, so that the application runs smoothly and provides good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement efficient pagination
2. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL use appropriate cache eviction strategies
3. WHEN performing database queries THEN the system SHALL optimize for performance
4. IF memory leaks exist THEN the system SHALL fix them with proper resource disposal
5. WHEN handling real-time updates THEN the system SHALL minimize unnecessary rebuilds

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want robust error handling throughout the application, so that I receive helpful feedback and the app remains stable during failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry mechanisms
3. WHEN data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show appropriate fallback states
4. IF exceptions are thrown THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully
5. WHEN recovering from errors THEN the system SHALL restore to a stable state

### Requirement 8: Security and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be secure and protected, so that I can trust the application with my personal information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL implement proper access controls
2. WHEN validating inputs THEN the system SHALL prevent injection attacks
3. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL use appropriate encryption
4. IF security vulnerabilities exist THEN the system SHALL fix them immediately
5. WHEN implementing authentication THEN the system SHALL follow security best practices

### Requirement 9: Documentation and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and maintainable code structure, so that the project can be easily understood and extended.

#### Acceptance Criteria
