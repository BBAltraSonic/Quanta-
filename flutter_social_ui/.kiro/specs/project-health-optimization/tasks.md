## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Tasks 1-3)

These tasks address compilation errors that prevent the project from building. Must be completed first.

### Phase 2: Infrastructure (Tasks 4-6)

These tasks fix the development infrastructure including imports, logging, and test suite.

### Phase 3: Functionality (Tasks 7-9)

These tasks ensure all features work correctly with proper error handling.

### Phase 4: Quality & Security (Tasks 10-11)

These tasks improve code quality, security, and maintainability.

### Phase 5: Validation (Task 12)

Final validation to ensure all fixes work correctly and no regressions were introduced.
