# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the current user-centric profile system into an avatar-centric profile system where profiles represent virtual avatars rather than the human creators behind them. This shift aligns with the app's core concept as a virtual influencer platform where avatars are the primary content creators and public-facing entities. The feature ensures that users interact with avatar personas while providing creators with appropriate management tools for their avatars.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Avatar Profile Display

**User Story:** As a user browsing the app, I want to view avatar profiles instead of creator profiles, so that I can engage with virtual influencers as intended personas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a profile THEN the system SHALL display the active avatar's information (name, bio, avatar image, stats)
2. WHEN displaying profile information THEN the system SHALL show avatar-specific data (avatar followers, avatar posts, avatar engagement metrics)
3. WHEN no active avatar exists THEN the system SHALL display a prompt to create an avatar
4. IF an avatar has a backstory THEN the system SHALL include it in the profile display
5. WHEN showing avatar stats THEN the system SHALL display followers, posts, likes, and engagement rate specific to that avatar

### Requirement 2: Owner vs Public Profile Views

**User Story:** As an avatar creator, I want different profile views when viewing my own avatar versus when others view it, so that I can manage my avatar while others see the public persona.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the logged-in user views their own avatar profile THEN the system SHALL display owner controls (edit avatar, settings, analytics, avatar switching)
2. WHEN another user views an avatar profile THEN the system SHALL display public interaction controls (follow, message, report, share)
3. WHEN in owner view THEN the system SHALL show private analytics and management options
4. WHEN in public view THEN the system SHALL hide all management controls and show only public engagement options
5. IF the owner has multiple avatars THEN the system SHALL provide avatar switching controls in owner view only

### Requirement 3: Avatar Switching and Management

**User Story:** As a creator with multiple avatars, I want to easily switch between my avatars and manage which one is active, so that I can control which persona is currently representing me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a creator has multiple avatars THEN the system SHALL provide an avatar switching interface (dropdown, modal, or carousel)
2. WHEN switching avatars THEN the system SHALL update the active avatar and refresh the profile display
3. WHEN an avatar is set as active THEN the system SHALL use it for all profile navigation and content creation
4. IF no avatar is active THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to select or create an avatar
5. WHEN switching avatars THEN the system SHALL persist the selection across app sessions

### Requirement 4: Navigation and Routing Updates

**User Story:** As a user navigating the app, I want the profile tab to always show the currently active avatar's profile, so that navigation is consistent with the avatar-centric approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps the profile tab THEN the system SHALL navigate to the currently active avatar's profile
2. WHEN viewing another user's profile THEN the system SHALL show their active avatar's profile
3. WHEN deep-linking to a profile THEN the system SHALL resolve to the appropriate avatar profile
4. IF a user has no active avatar THEN the profile tab SHALL navigate to avatar creation flow
5. WHEN navigating between profiles THEN the system SHALL maintain proper back navigation context

### Requirement 5: Database and State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to properly manage avatar state and database relationships, so that the avatar-centric profile system functions reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL load the user's active avatar from the database
2. WHEN avatar data changes THEN the system SHALL update the local state and sync with the database
3. WHEN switching avatars THEN the system SHALL update the active_avatar_id in the user record
4. IF database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and fallback states
5. WHEN multiple app instances exist THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent avatar state across instances

### Requirement 6: Content Association and Ownership

**User Story:** As a creator, I want all my content to be properly associated with the correct avatar, so that each avatar maintains its own content history and identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying posts on an avatar profile THEN the system SHALL show only posts created by that specific avatar
2. WHEN creating new content THEN the system SHALL associate it with the currently active avatar
3. WHEN switching avatars THEN the system SHALL not affect existing content associations
4. IF an avatar is deleted THEN the system SHALL handle content ownership appropriately (transfer or archive)
5. WHEN viewing avatar analytics THEN the system SHALL show metrics specific to that avatar's content

### Requirement 7: Follow and Interaction System Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want to follow specific avatars rather than creators, so that my feed reflects the virtual influencers I'm interested in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN following a profile THEN the system SHALL follow the specific avatar, not the creator
2. WHEN an avatar is deactivated THEN the system SHALL handle follower relationships appropriately
3. WHEN displaying follower counts THEN the system SHALL show avatar-specific follower numbers
4. IF a creator switches active avatars THEN existing follows SHALL remain with the original avatars
5. WHEN unfollowing THEN the system SHALL remove the follow relationship for that specific avatar

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want my current profile data to be preserved during the transition to avatar-centric profiles, so that I don't lose my content and connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system migrates existing users THEN it SHALL create default avatars from existing profile data
2. WHEN migrating content THEN the system SHALL associate existing posts with the appropriate avatar
3. WHEN migrating follows THEN the system SHALL convert user follows to avatar follows where possible
4. IF migration fails for any user THEN the system SHALL provide recovery mechanisms
5. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality with avatar-centric data
