# Post Detail Screen - Usage Examples

The `PostDetailScreen` has been fully refactored and now supports multiple use cases:

## 1. Single Post View (with Post ID)
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => PostDetailScreen(
      postId: 'your-post-id-here',
    ),
  ),
);
```

## 2. Single Post View (with Post Object)
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => PostDetailScreen(
      initialPost: yourPostModel,
    ),
  ),
);
```

## 3. Feed View (multiple posts)
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => PostDetailScreen(),
