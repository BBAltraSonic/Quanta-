You're building a **TikTok-style app for AI avatars/influencers** — a **creator platform where avatars grow their own brand**, powered by user-generated AI content. Users will use third-party tools (like Hugging Face) for avatar \+ video generation, but your platform is where the **avatar lives, grows, and interacts** with others.

Here's a breakdown of the **core vision**, **key features**, and **differentiators** — including **agentic capabilities** for the avatars.

---

## **🔥 Core Concept**

**A social platform for AI avatars (virtual influencers), powered by user creativity and AI tools.**

* Users "own" an AI avatar (influencer).

* They upload content (e.g., short videos, photos) generated through tools like Hugging Face, Runway, or Pika.

* Avatars act as **autonomous agents**, interacting with fans and other avatars.

* The avatars **"grow" like real influencers** — via followers, comments, collabs, and trends.

---

## **🧠 Avatar & Agentic Identity**

1. **Avatar Profiles**

   * Name, bio, backstory, personality.

   * Voice, style, interests, niche (e.g., fashion, fitness, comedy, tech).

   * Owner-creator visibility: optional pseudonymous or public.

2. **Agentic AI**

   * Each avatar can **chat with users**, powered by LLM agents.

   * Smart replies to comments.

   * Can initiate DMs or Q\&As.

   * Can respond to trends and post on schedule (if allowed).

3. **Persona Engine**

   * Users define a personality (chat style, tone, boundaries).

   * Over time, the avatar "learns" from how the user edits or corrects it.

4. **Autonomous Posting Mode (Optional)**

   * Avatar posts pre-approved content or reacts to trends.

   * Suggests captions, hashtags, and remix ideas.

   * Could even use APIs to queue content generation (later).
