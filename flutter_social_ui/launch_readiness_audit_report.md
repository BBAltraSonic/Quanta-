## üéØ Launch Decision

### ‚ùå **NO GO - CRITICAL BLOCKERS PRESENT**

**Reasoning:**
While the application demonstrates excellent technical architecture and feature completeness, several critical security vulnerabilities and missing store requirements prevent safe production deployment. The security issues alone constitute unacceptable risk for user data protection.

**Minimum Timeline to Launch:** 4-6 weeks

**Next Steps:**
1. Address all critical security vulnerabilities
2. Complete store submission requirements  
3. Implement production monitoring
4. Add privacy compliance features
5. Complete comprehensive testing

**Recommendation:** Focus on the Phase 1 critical blockers first, then reassess launch readiness after addressing security and store requirements.
