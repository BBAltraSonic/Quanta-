# Storage RLS Policy Fix - Database Changes

## Overview
Fixed critical RLS policy violations preventing media uploads to Supabase Storage. The core issue was a SQL bug in storage policies that incorrectly referenced table columns.

## Problem
- **Error**: `StorageException(message: new row violates row-level security policy, statusCode: 403, error: Unauthorized)`
- **Root Cause**: Storage policy incorrectly referenced `storage.foldername(avatars.name)[1]` instead of `storage.foldername(objects.name)[1]`
- **Impact**: All media uploads were failing due to RLS policy violations

## Database Changes Applied

### 1. Fixed Storage Policy SQL Bug
```sql
-- Applied migration: fix_storage_policies_corrected
-- Dropped incorrect policies and recreated with proper object name reference

CREATE POLICY "Avatar owners can upload post media" ON storage.objects
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
        bucket_id = 'posts' AND 
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM public.avatars 
            WHERE owner_user_id = auth.uid() AND 
                  id::text = (storage.foldername(objects.name))[1]
        )
    );

-- Added UPDATE and DELETE policies for complete CRUD coverage
-- Policies now correctly extract avatar_id from storage path: {avatar_id}/filename.ext
```

### 2. Enhanced RLS Security Coverage
```sql
-- Applied migration: enable_rls_missing_tables
-- Enabled RLS on tables flagged by security advisor

ALTER TABLE public.content ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.chat_messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.followers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.remixes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Added appropriate policies to maintain functionality while ensuring security
```

## Validation Results

### Storage Policy Test
- ✅ Folder structure `{avatar_id}/{filename}` correctly parsed
- ✅ `storage.foldername()` properly extracts avatar ID
- ✅ Avatar ownership verification works correctly
- ✅ Policy allows uploads for authorized users only

### Security Analysis
- ✅ No critical RLS disabled errors remain
- ✅ Storage-related security vulnerabilities resolved  
- ✅ Proper avatar-scoped access control maintained

## Expected Impact
- Media uploads should now succeed for authenticated users
- Users can only upload to their own avatar folders
- Security maintained with proper RLS enforcement
- No changes required to Flutter application code

## Technical Details

**Policy Logic Flow**:
1. Extract avatar ID from storage path using `(storage.foldername(objects.name))[1]`
2. Verify current user owns avatar with matching ID
3. Allow upload only if ownership verified
4. Maintain folder isolation between different users' avatars

**Folder Structure**:
- Posts bucket: `posts/{avatar_id}/{unique_filename}.{ext}`
- Thumbnails: `posts/{avatar_id}/{unique_filename}_thumbnail.jpg`

## Applied Migrations
1. `fix_storage_policies` - Initial policy correction
2. `fix_storage_policies_corrected` - Corrected SQL reference
3. `enable_rls_missing_tables` - Enhanced security coverage
