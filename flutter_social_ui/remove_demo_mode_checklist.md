## Phase 1: Configuration Updates
- [x] Update `app_config.dart` - Remove demo environment and set to production
- [x] Update `utils/environment.dart` if needed for production configuration
- [x] Remove demo-related feature flags and conditionals from config

## Phase 2: Delete Demo Services
- [x] Delete `lib/services/demo_auth_service.dart`
- [x] Delete `lib/services/demo_content_service.dart` 
- [x] Delete `lib/services/demo_search_service.dart`

## Phase 3: Remove Service Wrappers
- [x] Delete `lib/services/auth_service_wrapper.dart`
- [x] Delete `lib/services/content_service_wrapper.dart`
- [x] Delete `lib/services/search_service_wrapper.dart`

## Phase 4: Update Service Imports and Usage
- [x] Update `main.dart` - Replace wrapper imports with direct service imports
- [x] Update all screens that use auth wrapper - Replace with AuthService
- [x] Update all screens that use content wrapper - Replace with ContentService
- [x] Update all screens that use search wrapper - Replace with SearchService

## Phase 5: Clean Up Demo Mode Conditionals
- [x] Remove demo mode checks from `main.dart` service initialization
- [x] Clean up demo mode conditionals in screen files
- [x] Remove demo-related debug prints and logging
- [x] Update testing service to remove demo mode references

## Phase 6: Asset and Placeholder Cleanup
- [x] Remove placeholder icon files from assets

- [x] Update asset references in pubspec.yaml if needed

## Phase 7: Final Verification
- [x] Run flutter analyze to check for any remaining issues
- [x] Build the app to ensure no compilation errors
- [x] Test core functionality (auth, content, search) works with production services
- [x] Verify no demo mode references remain in codebase

## Completion Criteria
- App builds successfully without any demo mode references
- All services use production Supabase integration directly
- No compilation errors or broken imports
