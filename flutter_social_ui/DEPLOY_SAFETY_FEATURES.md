# Safety Features Migration Deployment Guide

## Overview
This deployment implements the migration of safety features from SharedPreferences to Supabase tables as outlined in the home screen audit. This includes user blocking, muting, and content reporting functionality with proper database backing and Row Level Security (RLS).

## Files Created/Modified

### Database Files
- `database_safety_migration.sql` - Complete database schema for safety features
- Contains tables: `user_blocks`, `user_mutes`, `reports`, `view_events`
- Includes RLS policies, indexes, and utility functions

### Service Files
- `lib/services/user_safety_service.dart` - Completely rewritten with Supabase backend
- `lib/services/enhanced_feeds_service.dart` - Added mute functionality and feed filtering
- `lib/config/db_config.dart` - Added constants for new safety features

### Test Files
- `test_safety_migration_integration.dart` - Integration tests for safety features

### Widget Files
- `lib/widgets/report_content_dialog.dart` - User-friendly content reporting dialog

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Database Schema
Execute the database migration script in your Supabase project:

```sql
-- Run database_safety_migration.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
-- This creates all necessary tables, policies, and functions
```

### 2. Verify Database Setup
Check that the following tables were created:
- `public.user_blocks`
- `public.user_mutes` 
- `public.reports`
- `public.view_events`

### 3. Verify RLS Policies
Ensure Row Level Security is enabled and policies are active:
```sql
-- Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('user_blocks', 'user_mutes', 'reports', 'view_events');

-- Check policies exist
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('user_blocks', 'user_mutes', 'reports', 'view_events');
```

### 4. Deploy App Code
Update your Flutter app with the modified service files. The migration will happen automatically on first app launch for authenticated users.

### 5. Test Migration
Use the integration test file to verify functionality:
```bash
# Run the test file in your testing environment
flutter test test_safety_migration_integration.dart
```

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Automatic Migration
- Existing SharedPreferences data is automatically migrated to Supabase
- Migration runs once per user on first app launch after update
- Local data is safely cleared after successful migration
- Migration failure handling with retry capability

### ✅ User Blocking
- Server-side user blocking with immediate effect
- Blocked users' content is filtered from feeds
- Block status checking with database functions
- Proper authentication and self-block prevention

### ✅ User Muting
- Temporary and permanent user muting
- Automatic expiration handling with database triggers
- Expired mutes are automatically cleaned up
- Duration options: 15min, 1hr, 24hr, 7 days, indefinite

### ✅ Content Reporting
- Comprehensive content reporting system
- Support for posts, comments, messages, and profiles
- Report status tracking for moderation workflow
- Admin-accessible reports for moderation team

### ✅ Feed Filtering
- Database-level filtering for performance
- Automatic exclusion of blocked/muted users from feeds
- Optional safety filtering can be disabled per request
- Efficient subqueries to minimize data transfer

### ✅ Safety Settings
- User safety preferences still stored locally
- Content filtering based on user preferences
- Explicit content and violence filtering options

## Database Schema Details

### user_blocks Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.user_blocks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    blocker_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    blocked_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    UNIQUE(blocker_user_id, blocked_user_id)
);
```

### user_mutes Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.user_mutes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    muter_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    muted_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    muted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    duration_minutes INTEGER,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    UNIQUE(muter_user_id, muted_user_id)
);
```

### reports Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.reports (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    post_id UUID REFERENCES posts(id),
    comment_id UUID REFERENCES comments(id),
    reported_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    content_type TEXT CHECK (content_type IN ('post', 'comment', 'message', 'profile')),
    report_type TEXT CHECK (report_type IN ('spam', 'inappropriate', 'harassment', 'copyright', 'other')),
    reason TEXT,
    details TEXT,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only access their own blocks, mutes, and reports
- Admins and moderators can access all reports for moderation
- Proper isolation between users' safety data

### Database Functions
- `is_user_muted(muter_id, muted_id)` - Check mute status with cleanup
- `is_user_blocked(blocker_id, blocked_id)` - Check block status
- `cleanup_expired_mutes()` - Automatic cleanup of expired mutes

### Constraints
- Self-blocking and self-muting prevention
- Unique constraints to prevent duplicate blocks/mutes
- Content type validation for reports

## Performance Optimizations

### Indexes
- Optimized indexes on user relationships and timestamps
- Foreign key indexes for fast lookups
- Composite indexes for query optimization

### Query Efficiency
- Database-level filtering in feed queries
- Subqueries to exclude blocked/muted content
- Minimal data transfer with targeted selects

## Monitoring and Analytics

### View Events
- Track user content viewing behavior
- Analytics for content performance
- User engagement metrics

### Safety Statistics
- Comprehensive safety statistics API
- Migration status tracking
- Report and action counts

## Migration Considerations

### Data Integrity
- All existing local data is preserved during migration
- Failed migrations can be retried
- Rollback capability if needed

### User Experience
- Migration happens transparently in background
- No interruption to user workflow
- Immediate availability of new features

### Backward Compatibility
- Old safety settings are preserved
- Gradual transition from local to server storage
- Fallback mechanisms for connectivity issues

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Database schema deployed successfully
- [ ] RLS policies active and correct
- [ ] Migration runs without errors
- [ ] Blocking functionality works end-to-end
- [ ] Muting functionality with expiration works
- [ ] Content reporting creates proper records
- [ ] Feed filtering excludes blocked/muted users
- [ ] Safety statistics API returns correct data
- [ ] Integration tests pass

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Migration fails**: Check user authentication and database connectivity
2. **RLS errors**: Verify policies are correctly applied and user is authenticated  
3. **Feed not filtering**: Check safety filtering is enabled and user has blocks/mutes
4. **Performance issues**: Verify indexes are created and queries are optimized

### Debug Tools
- Use the manual test runner in the integration test file
- Check safety statistics API for current state
- Monitor database logs for RLS policy violations
- Use the force migration function for testing

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 3 Considerations
- Advanced content filtering algorithms
- Machine learning-based moderation
- Community-based reporting and moderation
- Cross-platform safety synchronization
- Real-time safety action notifications

This implementation provides a solid foundation for user safety features with proper database backing, security, and performance considerations.
