## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES - MUST FIX BEFORE PRODUCTION**

### 1. **SECURITY VULNERABILITIES** 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY**

#### **API Keys Exposed in Code**
```dart
// CRITICAL: Hard-coded API keys in lib/config/app_config.dart
static const String supabaseAnonKey = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...';
static const String openRouterApiKey = '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';
```

**Impact**: Severe security risk, API keys can be extracted from compiled app
**Solution**: Implement proper environment variable management

#### **Missing Production Environment Configuration**
- Environment hardcoded to `Environment.development`
- No secure configuration management
- Debug information exposed in production builds

### 2. **APP STORE COMPLIANCE** 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY**

#### **Android Bundle ID Issues**
```kotlin
// android/app/build.gradle.kts
applicationId = "com.example.flutter_social_ui"  // Generic example ID
```

**Impact**: Cannot publish to app stores with example package name
**Solution**: Update to proper production bundle ID

#### **Missing Release Signing Configuration**
```kotlin
// Using debug keys for release builds
signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("debug")
```

**Impact**: Cannot publish to production app stores
**Solution**: Configure proper release signing

### 3. **PRODUCTION MONITORING** 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

#### **No Crash Reporting**
```dart
// TODO: In production, send to crash reporting service
// Examples: Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry, etc.
```

**Impact**: Cannot track production issues or crashes
**Solution**: Implement Firebase Crashlytics or Sentry

### 4. **INCOMPLETE FEATURES** 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

#### **Mock AI Implementation**
- AI services return simulated responses
- No actual OpenAI/Claude integration
- Chat functionality not connected to real AI

**Impact**: Core AI features won't work in production
**Solution**: Complete AI service integration
